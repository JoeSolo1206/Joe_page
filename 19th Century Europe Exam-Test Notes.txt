19th Century Europe Exam-Test Notes (1848)
* Conservatism: The 19th century was in many ways antithetical to conservatism, both as a political philosophy and as a program of particular parties identified with conservative interests. The Enlightenment had engendered widespread belief in the possibility of improving the human condition—a belief, that is, in the idea of progress—and a rationalist disposition to tamper with or discard existing institutions or practices in pursuit of that goal.
* Liberalism: Philosopher John Locke is often credited with founding liberalism as a distinct tradition based on the social contract, arguing that each man has a natural right to life, liberty, and property, and governments must not violate these rights.
* Marxism: Marxism is a social, economic, and political philosophy that analyzes the impact of the ruling class on the laborers, leading to the uneven distribution of wealth and privileges in society. It stimulates the workers to protest the injustice.
* Socialism: social and economic doctrine that calls for public rather than private ownership or control of property and natural resources. According to the socialist view, individuals do not live or work in isolation but live in cooperation with one another.


France:
*  There were many reasons they had a revolution, like famine and wanting more of a socialist society 
* Before the election, the king abdicated from the civil discontent in the country at the time
* After the election, most socialists were upset that monarch rulers were elected so they would be held down
* They got some universal suffrage, until Napoleon III, who pretty much took it away


Germany:
*  They had three revolutions and each one failed 
   * (1) reformist Bill: revolted against their landlords and the king abdicated 
   * (2) Economic Relief: Help to finance railways near Saxony and other regions 
   * (3) Nationalist Movement: To unify Germany into one nation and not split into dozens and dozens of smaller German states 
* Frankfurt Assembly: The Frankfurt Parliament was the first freely elected parliament for all German states, including the German-populated areas of the Austrian Empire, elected on 1 May 1848.
Italy:
*  The 1848 Revolutions in the Italian States, part of the wider Revolutions of 1848 in Europe, were organized revolts in the states of the Italian Peninsula and Sicily, led by intellectuals and agitators who desired a liberal government. 
   * As Italian nationalists, they sought to eliminate reactionary Austrian control. (Loose control)
* During this time, Italy was not a unified country and was divided into many states, which, in Northern Italy, were ruled directly or indirectly by the Austrian Empire. 
* A desire to be independent from foreign rule, and the conservative leadership of the Austrians, led Italian revolutionaries to stage a revolution to drive out the Austrians.
* Irredentist: a person advocating the restoration to their country of any territory formerly belonging to it.
